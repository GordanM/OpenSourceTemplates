# OpenSourceTemplates
A set of templates that aim to follow community best practices around 
releasing open source software.

Please feel free to use these templates as a starting point for text
and headers in your own project and feel free to send patches on
improvements if you've got them. Perhaps begin with our
CONTRIBUTING.md file?
